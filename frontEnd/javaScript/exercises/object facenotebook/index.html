        You are a billionaire entrepreneur and have your own social network. When you started your network, 50 users
        joined immediately.
        at the start, you created 5 cool events that the users can join.
        events have name, date, description and users that joined
        every user has:
        a profile picture with a link to the image (any link) and an alt text (lorem ipsum) and a flag that says itâ€™s
        the main profile picture
        an album of pictures with the same properties as the profile one
        a short biography with a header title and a paragraph that says something about the user (also lorem ipsum)
        a list of stories with a header title and a paragraph that also have a date when they were released. The list
        is sorted by date, beginning from newest.
        a list of friends that are users with the same properties that the user has. Maximum 5.
        The NSA came to your office and demanded you to list all the users that joined the network and all events. (In
        console.log)
